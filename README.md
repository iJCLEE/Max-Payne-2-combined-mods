Welcome! You are about to play the Long Awaited combined mods: Kung Fu Evolution + First person! - Combined by JCLEE

Some people asked about Max Payne 2 Kung Fu Evolution with First person mod and no one combines them, so i took this project and combined them for Max Payne players who want to enjoy Kung Fu Evolution with First person mode!

How to install:
- Just simply put all files from rar/zip into your Max Payne 2 install folder.

(if you want to change character in normal gameplay) - Make sure to have set developer mode on. Right click on the MaxPayne2 shortcut on your desktop and add: -developer -developerkeys -screenshots after maxpayne2.exe" (Eg, "D:\Spil\RockstarGames\Max Payne 2\MaxPayne2.exe" -developer -developerkeys -screenshot ) This has to be done so you can select alternate skins for some characters by pressing the PG UP og PG DOWN button. I ran into limits of the Max Payne 2 engine that stopped me from making the alternate skins selectable from menu. Start Max Payne 2 and select Kung Fu Evolution from the drop down box.

How to play:

- MB1 - Shoot
- MB2 - Bullettime Combo
- E - Use
- F - Bullettime Only
Is the setup we will recommend people for best controls. Then go to Start Kung Fu Evolution and select Dojo where you'll learn the basics of the Kung fu system!

F10 button for screenshots.
